  "description": "The goal of this homework is to write a service that can convert programs in lisp into their javascript equivalent. You're free to implement this service in any mainstram language / tool chain of your choice. Your service should work for basic arithmetic; variable declaration, function declaration, function calls, and closures; basic loops and branching. The service works on a simplified version of lisp -- no need to attempt to support the language in its entirety.",
